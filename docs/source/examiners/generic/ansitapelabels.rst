AnsiTapeLabels - ANSI/ECMA13 Tape Labels
========================================

This examiner interprets ANSI tape labels and splits out the files
they enclose as separate artifacts.

The actual ANSI standard is expensive to get hold of, so this implementation
is based on the ECMA-13 document, as available from bitsavers.org:

http://bitsavers.org/pdf/ecma/ECMA-013.pdf

Only a subset of the standard has been implemented so far.
