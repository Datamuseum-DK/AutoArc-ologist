   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

AutoArchaeologist's manuals
===========================

There's not much substance here yet because AA started out as hack,
turned into a bunch of hacks, got rewritten into somewhat structured
hacks, then became a library for writing hacks and so on.

I have relatively good confidence that the fundamental data structures
and classes have settled down now, and as I go through things I will
try to document them properly here.

Right now you wont get far if you cannot program in python, but I plan
to add a command-line interface to AA which makes it usable for more
normal people too.
